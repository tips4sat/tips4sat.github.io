The so-called SQ3R study method is a popular system designed to strengthen students\u2019 reading muscles. SQ3R stands for \u201cSurvey, Question, Read, Recite, Review\u201d \u2013 and one of its greatest benefits is that it helps you understand more of what you\u2019re reading as you\u2019re reading it - the first time . As a larger methodology, SQ3R can be extended over an entire course, textbook, or semester, but this article focuses on how this step-by-step approach can help you on the SAT Reading Test. Step 1: Survey Resist the temptation to jump right into reading the passage. Instead, glance through (or survey ) the passage to identify the subject matter, the point of view, and the overall purpose of the passage. This should take no more than two minutes. Read the blurb for context The blurb is the little block of small text above the passage \u2013 it will give you some context for the passage, including the author and the date of publication Skim the first sentence of every paragraph. IMPORTANT: Survey the questions, too! Put marks in the margins of the passage if you see questions that mention \u201cparagraph 3\u201d or \u201clines 11-18\u201d , for example. Circle weird names and big words in the questions When you circle a key word in the text of a question, you increase the chances that you will remember that the word or idea is important when you come across it in the passage. Don\u2019t try to remember all of the stuff you\u2019re circling \u2013 just trust your subconscious brain. Step 2: Question Basically, this part is meant to help you get excited about what you\u2019re about to read - if you\u2019re interested in what the passage is about, then you are more likely to grasp the point the author is making the first time you read it. In 30 seconds or less, come up with a couple questions about the passage, for example: What is this passage about? Why does this passage exist? What question is this passage trying to answer? Step 3: Read (R1) Start reading the passage \u2013 actively . Underline and/or circle claims. A claim is a statement that can be argued or proven with evidence. The non-Literature passages on the SAT include a claim in almost every paragraph. Claims are usually then supported with details or evidence. You could also think of claims as \"the points\" of paragraphs. If you can tell the difference between the sentences in a passage that include claims and the ones that are supporting the claims with evidence, you're well on your way to fluency! Underline and/or circle key words. Key words are words or concepts that are central to the claim or claims that the author is making. It's the big picture stuff you should be circling \u2013 not the details. Make quick notes in the margins of the passage: Is the author supporting an idea? Circle a word or phrase and put a plus ( + ) in the margin next to it! Is the author rejecting an idea? Circle the phrase and write a minus ( \u2013 ) next to it! Is something surprising (to you or to the author or to a character/researcher mentioned in the text)? Circle or underline the thing and put an exclamation point ( ! ) next to it! Is something confusing (either to you or to the author or to somebody mentioned in the text)? Write a question mark! ( ? ) Circle \u201cthe But\u201d! Contrast words ( eg: although, not, but, yet, however, nevertheless, in fact, etc... ) signal a shift in the author\u2019s argument, which is always important to pay attention to. Circling them is fun! \u2013 and it helps your brain pay better attention. Circle \"the And\"! Continuation words ( because, since, therefore, and, additionally, etc... ) signal that the author is about to emphasize or restate an important part of the argument. The same is true for semicolons! ( ; ) Pay attention to these! TOP TIP: The most important claims and conclusions are usually found in the first and last sentences of a paragraph. On your first read-through, pay more attention to the bones of the passage, and less attention to the evidence that backs up those claims and conclusions. If you understand the structure of the passage first, you\u2019ll know where to find the supporting evidence you need if and when you are asked about it. Ever finish reading a paragraph and realize you have no idea what you just read? That\u2019s passive reading. Your eyes might have seen all of the words, but your brain didn\u2019t focus and engage with them and decode them into an idea that makes sense. Passive reading usually results in poor comprehension and failure to grasp the point the passage is making. Step 4: Recite (R2) This is the most important part of effective Active Reading . The second \"R\" stands for Recite \u2013 in your own words . After you read each paragraph, say back to yourself what it was about - using your own words . By summarizing, you can gain control of the text and prove to yourself that you understand what you just read. Step 5: Review (R3) Once you reach the end of the passage, say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is - again, using your own words . Next, start working through the questions! This system might be pretty different from what you\u2019ve done in the past, but it might just be the major shift in approach that you need to raise your score on the Reading Test to the next level.","title":"SQ3R <small>Active Reading</small>"},{"location":"reading/khan_academy/01_active_reading/#sq3r-active-reading","text":"","title":"SQ3R Active Reading"},{"location":"reading/khan_academy/01_active_reading/#what-is-sq3r","text":"The so-called SQ3R study method is a popular system designed to strengthen students\u2019 reading muscles.

Just to make this technique a little more memorable, we\u2019re going to call it RIP-RAP : Rephrase If Possible (RIP) Read Around and Predict (RAP) Let\u2019s take a closer look at how this method works as you work through each question: Step 1: Cover the choices Yes, you read that right - don\u2019t look at the choices until you have an idea of what you think the answer is - in your own words. Just do it, and trust yourself! Step 2: If possible, Rephrase the question using How What or Why This way, you can turn a half-statement that trails off at the end, like \u201c The function of the 3rd paragraph can best be described as\u2026 \u201d into a pointed, direct question: \u201c What does the 3rd paragraph DO? \u201d This is incredibly helpful, because it\u2019s easier to remember a simplified version of the question when you\u2019re searching in the passage for the answer. Step 3: Read Around and Predict: RAP Now that you\u2019re in control of the question, you are going to try to answer it in your own words - again, before you look at the choices . Find the answer to your version of the question in the passage. Read around line reference questions - look at transitions if necessary, and focus on the first and last sentences of each paragraph, especially the first and last paragraphs. Then: answer your question in your own words. Uncover the choices. Cross out the ones that don\u2019t match. Examples Example 1: \u201c The author includes the discussion of the scone, the doughnut and the muffin primarily to\u2026 \u201d RIP it! \u2013 Rephrase: \u201c Why does the author talk so much about the different pastry? \u201d \u201c What does the discussion of the pastry DO? \u201d RAP it! \u2013 Predict: Read around the line reference and come up with an answer to your own version of the question in your own words . For example: \u201c To show how much Jackson loves sweets \u201d \u201c To reveal the arbitrary standards Alex uses to choose her friends \u201d \u201c To show that the waitress is an expert. \u201d Then, cross out choices that don\u2019t match. Trust your answer! Example 2: \u201c In the context of the passage, the author\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdelicately, we devoured the pastry\u201d is primarily meant to convey the idea that\u2026 \u201d RIP it! \u2013 Rephrase: \u201c What does the phrase DO? \" \" What is its purpose? \u201d \u201c Why is the author talking like this? \u201d RAP it! \u2013 Predict: Read around the reference, review the first sentence of the paragraph to confirm what the point of the paragraph is supposed to be, and answer your version of the question. For example: \" To add a lighthearted touch to the story \" \" To emphasize the narrator's conflicted state \" Then, cross out choices that don\u2019t match. Trust your answer! Example 3: \u201c Over the course of the passage, the main focus of the narrative shifts from the\u2026 \u201d RIP it! \u2013 Rephrase: \u201cWhat is going on in the passage? How does its focus shift as it goes along?\u201d RAP it! \u2013 Predict: Review the first and last sentences of every paragraph, especially the first and last paragraphs. Summarize what is happening in the passage in your own words, eg: \u201c Author meets with friends at shop, describes friends; author then describes the sensuous experience of eating a doughnut. \u201d It is very likely that the correct choice will match YOUR description. Cross out choices that feature words that don\u2019t seem like they fit. Trust yourself! TOP TIP: If you\u2019re left with two choices, re-read the question and make sure you understand what it\u2019s asking. Circle or underline key words in the question. Then, go back and read around again - the correct choice will have evidence in the passage text that supports it. Remember - there is only one answer! If choice A makes you think \u201chey now, that\u2019s interesting, maybe that\u2019s right\u201d and choice B basically restates what you read in passage, choose B - every time. There is only one answer: if you think two answers seem equally right, you\u2019re missing something. The SAT can\u2019t use questions for which the answers are debatable. One choice is correct, and the others are wrong. NOTE: Many students find that if they just read the passage, then read the questions, and choose the choices that look or sound best, they make mistakes. The choices all sound pretty good! But your job isn\u2019t to select the choice that sounds best - it\u2019s to choose the one that answers the exact question that is being asked \u2013 and the correct choice is always the one that has evidence in the passage to support it! Q: What is the most important feature of the right answer on the SAT Reading Test? A: It has evidence that proves that it is right \u2013 right there in the passage. The above system is just one way to approach some questions on the SAT Reading Test. Many students find it gives them a specific, useful approach for a specific subset of question types.","title":"Rephrase and Predict <small>Active Reading</small>"},{"location":"reading/khan_academy/02_rephrase_predict/#rephrase-and-predict-active-reading","text":"This technique gives you control over several question types on the SAT Reading Test, and then it helps you come up with your own answer before you look at the choices.

One choice is correct, and the others are wrong. NOTE: Many students find that if they just read the passage, then read the questions, and choose the choices that look or sound best, they make mistakes. The choices all sound pretty good! But your job isn\u2019t to select the choice that sounds best - it\u2019s to choose the one that answers the exact question that is being asked \u2013 and the correct choice is always the one that has evidence in the passage to support it! Q: What is the most important feature of the right answer on the SAT Reading Test? A: It has evidence that proves that it is right \u2013 right there in the passage. The above system is just one way to approach some questions on the SAT Reading Test. Many students find it gives them a specific, useful approach for a specific subset of question types.","title":"Examples"},{"location":"vocabulary/","text":"Visual Vocabulary Visualize Your Vocabulary: Turn Any SAT/ACT Word into a Picture and Remember It Forever (Kindle Locations 221-235).

That means underlining and circling the most important elements so you can stay engaged with the point the author is making. More on active reading strategies here. TOP TIP: Understand what the passage is saying! Contrary to what some people think, the SAT Writing and Language Test is not just about grammar. Grammar-related questions (also called \"Standard English Conventions\") make up just one part of your score on the Writing and Language test. The other questions (the ones that fall into the \"Expression of Ideas\" category) require you to understand the point of the passage and the function of each paragraph within it, along with the function of each sentence in each paragraph. Underlining, circling and annotating can help. 2) Circle or underline important elements of questions Many of the more challenging \u201cExpression of Ideas\u201d questions on the Writing and Language Test tell you very specifically what the correct choice has to do. It can help a lot to zero in on that part of the question, and just do what the question wants. TOP TIP: A wrong word can disqualify a choice! Always remember that a single word can make a choice wrong. If you find yourself making excuses for a choice, eg: \u201cWell, this could totally work if only\u2026\u201d or \u201cI could see how this might work\u2026\u201d, the choice is probably wrong. If a shoe doesn\u2019t quite fit, try a different pair of shoes. The College Board calls the ELA portion of the SAT \u201cEvidence-Based Reading and Writing\u201d for a reason: the answer to every question will have evidence to support it. NOTE: Remember that there are many questions on the Writing and Language Test that don\u2019t have questions at all - these are called \u201cstemless\u201d questions and your job is to select the best version of a brief underlined portion of the passage itself. These are always grammar questions that will contribute to your \u201cStandard English Conventions\u201d subscore. 3) Cross out extra words to simplify complex sentences If you\u2019re having trouble figuring out a grammar question, it can help to simplify the structure of complex sentences by crossing out extra words that describe \u2013 or \u201cmodify\u201d \u2013 the subject or the verb. 4) Use Process of Elimination! When you physically cross out a choice you have ruled out, it makes the rest of your task easier on your brain. Bad choices stop being distractions if you don't look at them again.

Why is it there? 2) Trust yourself \u2014Next, underline sentence X and ask yourself if it feels like it's in the right place. What is its function? Is it doing the right thing at the right time? 3) Test the choices \u2014Try out the locations suggested by the choices one by one and choose the position that makes the most sense to you. TOP TIP: Use pronouns to help. On this type of question you may notice that there are some very helpful pronouns nearby. Words like those , these , they , it , and even the can give you a clue as to the correct sequence of sentences in the paragraph. If the sentence says \" these steps ,\" for example, you know that the sentence needs to come after a sentence that mentions steps of some sort. If the sentence says \" the experiment ,\" then the chances are good that an experiment was mentioned in a prior sentence. TOP TIP: Look for sequencing clues. Sometimes you'll notice that the sentences in the paragraph are following a chronological\u2014or just plain logical\u2014progression. Chronology clues: first/then , next/finally , or before/after . Logic clues: since , because , however , therefore , although , yet , nevertheless , etc... These are important, helpful words\u2014underline or circle them and let them show you the way to sequencing the paragraph properly. When you see a question that looks like this: \"To make the passage most logical, paragraph X should be placed...\" Try this: 1) Your own words \u2014Work through the passage paragraph by paragraph and use your own words to describe what each paragraph is DOING\u2014what role does \"paragraph X\" serve in the entire passage? Why is it there? What is its point? TOP TIP: For this purpose, the first and last sentences of paragraphs are usually more helpful than the sentences in the middle. 2) Trust yourself! \u2014Next, circle \"paragraph X\" and ask yourself if it feels like it's in the right place. 3) Test the choices \u2014If it doesn't feel right where it is, try out the locations suggested by the choices, one by one, and choose the position that makes the most sense to you. TOP TIP: Use transition clues to help. The first and last sentences of each paragraph are the ones you should focus on. Most of the passages on the SAT Writing and Language Test flow fairly smoothly from one paragraph to the next. The last sentence of a paragraph may introduce the main idea of the next paragraph, or the first sentence of a paragraph may refer back to an idea from the preceding paragraph. If a transition seems a little random or \"jumpy,\" then you may have found the clue you need to get the question right. TOP TIP: Tell the story of the passage. Most of the passages follow a classic progression of introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion. The paragraphs usually move along in a logical or chronological sequence.

TOP TIP: Use pronouns to help. On this type of question you may notice that there are some very helpful pronouns nearby. Words like those , these , they , it , and even the can give you a clue as to the correct sequence of sentences in the paragraph. If the sentence says \" these steps ,\" for example, you know that the sentence needs to come after a sentence that mentions steps of some sort. If the sentence says \" the experiment ,\" then the chances are good that an experiment was mentioned in a prior sentence. TOP TIP: Look for sequencing clues. Sometimes you'll notice that the sentences in the paragraph are following a chronological\u2014or just plain logical\u2014progression. Chronology clues: first/then , next/finally , or before/after . Logic clues: since , because , however , therefore , although , yet , nevertheless , etc...

TOP TIP: Use transition clues to help. The first and last sentences of each paragraph are the ones you should focus on. Most of the passages on the SAT Writing and Language Test flow fairly smoothly from one paragraph to the next. The last sentence of a paragraph may introduce the main idea of the next paragraph, or the first sentence of a paragraph may refer back to an idea from the preceding paragraph. If a transition seems a little random or \"jumpy,\" then you may have found the clue you need to get the question right. TOP TIP: Tell the story of the passage. Most of the passages follow a classic progression of introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion. The paragraphs usually move along in a logical or chronological sequence. If one paragraph is talking about a famous person's early childhood, the next paragraph might discuss accomplishments in adolescence or early adulthood, followed by paragraphs discussing events that occurred in the subject's later life.

The rarer use of the semicolon on the SAT is to separate items in a series. This only happens if the list is complex and the items in it have their own punctuation (such as commas). What is an independent clause? An independent clause is a string of words that expresses a complete thought and could stand alone as a well-formed sentence. It must have a subject and a verb. Examples: Teddy loves stuffed bears. His collection includes fifty-four specimens. Alex cooks his brownies with lard. They taste great. Using semicolons to separate independent clauses In the above examples, a semicolon may be placed between the two related independent clauses in each pair: Teddy loves stuffed bears; his collection includes fifty-four specimens. Alex cooks his brownies with lard; they taste great! Note in these examples how the second clause adds directly to what\u2019s discussed in the first clause: In the first example, the second clause adds a factual detail that helps demonstrate Teddy\u2019s love for stuffed bears. In the second example, the second clause shares the writer\u2019s impression of the results of Alex\u2019s cooking. The \u201cBefore and After Test\u201d for semicolons On the SAT, a semicolon may be used to join two closely-related independent clauses. If both the first and the second parts of a sentence could stand alone as their own sentences\u2014and the second part adds to the first part\u2014then a semicolon can be acceptable. 1) Check the part before the semicolon \u2013 could it be a solo sentence? 2) Check the part after the semicolon \u2013 could it be a solo sentence? 3) If the answers to 1 and 2 are YES, and the two parts are closely related, then the semicolon is good to go. Top tip: A semicolon can\u2019t be used to join an independent and a dependent clause . (A dependent clause is one that contains a subject and a verb but that doesn\u2019t express a complete thought and couldn\u2019t stand alone as a well-formed sentence (e.g., because Teddy loves stuffed bears ). Beware the COMMA SPLICE WARNING: When you try to connect two independent clauses using just a comma, you create an error known as a comma splice. WRONG: Teddy loves stuffed bears, his collection includes fifty-four specimens. WRONG: Alex cooks his brownies with lard, they taste great! How to fix a COMMA SPLICE ERROR Option 1: Change the comma into a period ( . ) Two independent clauses can always stand alone as separate sentences (even if this isn\u2019t always the best choice rhetorically). Remember to adjust capitalization as needed! Option 2: Add a conjunction. A coordinating or subordinating conjunction can often be used to correct a comma splice: When a conjunction is present \u2013 such as , and , or , because , while or but \u2013 one of the two clauses is converted to a \u201cdependent\u201d or \u201csubordinate\u201d clause. (Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to know these terms on the SAT, but you do need to know your options for correcting a comma splice). RIGHT: Teddy loves stuffed bears, and his collection includes fifty-four specimens. RIGHT: Because Alex cooks his brownies with lard, they taste great. Option 3: Use a semicolon in place of the comma. If the independent clauses are closely related, they can sometimes be joined with a semicolon. RIGHT: Teddy loves stuffed bears; his collection includes fifty-four specimens. RIGHT: Alex cooks his brownies with lard; they taste great. The Colon ( : ) A colon ( : ) is sometimes used after a statement that introduces a list, a self-contained quotation, an explanation or an example. Examples: RIGHT: The English language abounds with irregular verbs: drink, drank, drunk; break, broke, broken; swim, swam, swum; shrink, shrank, shrunken; fall, fell, fallen; blow, blew, blown. RIGHT: The conscious brain controls only some of the body\u2019s functions: while we can exert some control over our breathing rate, we have less control over our heart rate, and, except via lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise, we cannot consciously influence the processes of our digestive or immune systems at all. RIGHT: Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address began with the following preamble: \u201cFour score and seven years ago.\u201d However, a colon shouldn\u2019t be used when the quotation is embedded in the sentence: WRONG: Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address begins with: \u201cFour score and seven years ago.\u201d TOP TIP: What comes before the colon must be (or contain) an independent clause: it must represent a complete thought and be able to function as a well-formed, standalone sentence. WRONG: Snape advised them to: stay up all night, practice spells, and eat bonbons. (\u201cSnape advised them to\u201d is not a full sentence) RIGHT: Snape advised them to stay up all night, practice spells, and eat bonbons. RIGHT: Snape gave them the best advice he could muster: stay up all night, practice spells, and eat bonbons. The Dash ( \u2013 ) One dash ( \u2013 ) = Colon ( : ) Just like the rule for colons, what comes before the single dash ( \u2013 ) must be an independent clause: it must be able to read as a complete sentence all on its own. ( See what we did there? We could have used a long dash instead of that colon ) NOTE: The dash ( \u2013 ) is not to be confused with the hyphen ( - ) , which has its own rules that are not tested on the SAT. Examples: You were right\u2014he did eat the whole thing. Learning to ride a unicycle is easy\u2014if you don\u2019t mind a few bumps and bruises. Two dashes ( \u2013 \u2013 ) = open/close parentheses ( ) Like a pair of commas or parentheses, a pair of dashes can be used to set off a phrase, clause, or series of phrases and clauses. In order for two dashes to be correct, the sentence that surrounds the clause that is being set off\u2014be it a descriptive flourish or a prepositional aside\u2014must be grammatically complete. TOP TIP: When in doubt, take it out! Think of the two dashes, two commas or two parentheses as chopping tools that can slice out nonessential elements. Remove the element in question, and read the sentence again\u2014if the sentence reads through without the element, then the double punctuation was OK!

Learning to ride a unicycle\u2013 a time-consuming endeavor \u2013 is easy if you don\u2019t mind a few bumps and bruises.

Development Development questions on the Writing and Language Test get to the heart of what the writer is trying to express. When you answer a Development question, you\u2019ll be looking for ways to enhance the writer\u2019s message by clarifying the main points, adding or changing supporting details, sharpening the focus, and \u2014 in some passages \u2014 using data from informational graphics such as tables, graphs, and charts to make the passage more accurate, more precise, and generally more effective. There are four different kinds of Development questions: Proposition: Add, revise, or leave unchanged thesis statements, topic sentences, or claims \u2013 in other words, the \u201cmain ideas\u201d of a passage or paragraph. Example: \"Which choice best introduces the main topic of the paragraph?\" Read the paragraph in question, say in your own words what the point is, and select the choice that best introduces that point. Process of elimination can help with these. Support: Add, revise, or leave unchanged evidence that supports a passage\u2019s points or claims Example: \"Which choice most effectively sets up the information that follows?\" Look at the information the question is referring to. Review the sentences before and after, and even the topic sentence of the paragraph. Select the choice that most clearly introduces the following sentence, and supports the point of the paragraph. Focus: Add, revise, leave unchanged, or delete material on the basis of relevance to the purpose (e.g., deleting an irrelevant sentence) These questions ask you to consider a new sentence that the writer wants to add or delete at a particular point in the passage. Example 1: \u201cThe writer is considering adding the following sentence . . . should the writer make this addition here?\u201d Example 2: \u201cThe writer is considering deleting the following sentence . . . should the writer make this deletion here?\u201d Your job is to decide whether the sentence should be kept or deleted, and why. Step 1: Say in your own words the function of the sentence being considered. What is the point of the sentence? What does it do? Step 2: Take a look at the topic sentence of the paragraph, and remind yourself of the point of the paragraph. Step 3 Review the sentences on either side of the sentence under consideration. The sentence might add relevant information to the passage, or it might blur the focus by being slightly off-topic, irrelevant or redundant. Does it fit? Then keep it! Is it off topic? Delete it! But make sure you keep it or delete it for the right reason! Quantitative information: Use data from informational graphics (e.g.: tables, graphs, charts) to enhance the accuracy, precision, and overall effectiveness of a passage. Example: \u201cWhich choice most effectively represents the information provided in the table?\u201d One way to do it: Look at the choices one by one, and compare them against the graphic to see if they are accurate. Only one will be a statement that is supported by the graphic. Organization: Some Expression of Ideas questions require you to improve the structure of a passage to enhance logic and cohesion \u2013 in other words, organize it. Here are some examples: Logical sequence: Make sure that material is presented in the most logical sequence. In these questions, sentences in a paragraph will be numbered. You will be asked to change the placement of an existing sentence or add a new sentence in the order that makes the most sense given the context of the passage. Check out this Tips Strategies article for more on how to approach these questions. Introductions, conclusions, and transitions: Improve the openings and closings of paragraphs and passages and the connections between and among information and ideas in a passage. Example 1: Which choice best concludes the passage? Example 2: Which choice provides the best transition to the topic of paragraph 3? Example 3: Which choice best introduces the topic of paragraph 2? Conclusion questions: Remind yourself what the passage is about: 1) Review the title of the passage 2) Say in your own words what the point of the passage is. Then, select the choice that best reflects that and ties it up. Don't introduce new information. Paragraph Introduction and Transition questions: Read the first and last sentences of the paragraphs before and after the transition. Then, again, using your own words, sum up the point of each paragraph. Best transition answers will smooth the transition and include a little of both paragraphs' points! Best introduction answers will usually make a claim that is supported by evidence in the rest of the paragraph. Effective Language Use: These questions ask you to revise text to improve written expression and to achieve the writer\u2019s purpose. Precision: Making word choice more exact or appropriate for the context Example: ...As Kingman developed as a painter, his works were often compared to paintings by Chinese landscape artists dating back to CE 960, a time when a strong tradition of landscape painting emerged in Chinese art. Kingman, however, vacated from that tradition in a number of ways, most notably in that he chose to focus not on natural landscapes, such as mountains and rivers, but on cities. . . . A) NO CHANGE B) evacuated C) departed D) retired All four of the tested words have something to do with \u201cleaving,\u201d but only one of them makes good contextual sense. It\u2019s not \u201cvacated\u201d \u2014 the version already in the passage \u2014 because while you might vacate, or leave, a place, you wouldn\u2019t \u201cvacate\u201d from a tradition. Similar problems occur if you try to use \u201cevacuated\u201d or \u201cretired\u201d in that context. Only \u201cdeparted\u201d (choice C) has both the correct general sense and says what it means to say. \"To depart from a tradition\" is an expression that means \"to vary from\" or \"to diverge from\" a tradition. Concision: Make word choice more economical by eliminating wordiness and redundancy. Example: Sometimes language can be repetitive, duplicative, and say the same thing more than once. A) repetitive B) wordy and verbose C) redundant and repetitive D) overly wordy and full of repeated repetitions of the same words used over and over again. The correct choice is A. Don\u2019t get fancy. Keep it simple! Sometimes this repetitiveness will be in the underlined portion of the passage itself, but other times you\u2019ll have to recognize that the writer made the same point elsewhere in the sentence or in the paragraph \u2013 in these cases, the correct choice might be to delete the entire thing for the sake of simplicity and clarity. Style and tone: Make word choice consistent with the overall style and tone of a passage. Example: \u201cWhich of the following best maintains the style and tone of the passage?\u201d The correct choices to these questions will match the tone of the rest of the passage. If the tone of the passage is academic, scientific or formal, then the answer won\u2019t be informal or slangy. If the tone of the passage is more friendly or casual, then the answer will share that easygoing friendliness. ;-) Syntax: combining sentences to improve the flow of language or to accomplish some particular rhetorical goal. Example: . . . During his career, Kingman exhibited his work internationally. He garnered much acclaim. . . Which choice most effectively combines the sentences at the underlined portion? A) internationally, and Kingman also garnered B) internationally; from exhibiting, he garnered C) internationally but garnered D) internationally, garnering There\u2019s nothing grammatically wrong with having two separate sentences here, but the question is asking you to combine them! The best answer here is choice D, which creates a logical, smooth connection between the two ideas without changing the meaning. (Idea 1: Kingman exhibited his work. Idea 2: Kingman earned recognition).","title":"Solving Expression of Ideas Questions"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/06_expression_of_ideas/#solving-expression-of-ideas-questions","text":"","title":"Solving Expression of Ideas Questions"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/06_expression_of_ideas/#expression-of-ideas-the-writing-and-language-test","text":"Questions that fall within the \u201cExpression of Ideas\u201d category focus on three broad elements: Development questions ask you to refine the content of a passage to achieve the writer\u2019s purpose Organization questions require you to improve the structure of a passage to enhance logic and cohesion Effective Language Use questions ask you to revise text to improve written expression and to achieve the writer\u2019s purpose In this three-part series of articles, we will look at these elements in greater detail, and share some strategies about how to approach them!","title":"Expression of Ideas: The Writing and Language Test"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/06_expression_of_ideas/#development","text":"Development questions on the Writing and Language Test get to the heart of what the writer is trying to express.

There are three main elements of Standard English Convention that the SAT is primarily concerned with: Sentence Structure, Conventions of Usage, and Conventions of Punctuation. What's a convention? \u201cConventions\u201d is just another way of saying \u201cstandard practices and expectations that people follow on a daily basis.\u201d We rely on conventions in most of life: driving in the correct lane, waiting our turn to pay at the store, making room for people on the sidewalk or in an elevator, and so much more. \u201cStandard English Conventions\u201d can be thought of as \u201cwriting guidelines.\u201d Of course, people violate language conventions all the time. Writers might intentionally ignore a convention to achieve a particular purpose; for example, sentence fragments break convention by lacking key elements of a typical sentence but, in certain cases, they can be very effective in creating emphasis, reflecting surprise or shock: Example: I just ate the last macaroon. The one with the sprinkles. \u201cThe one with sprinkles\u201d is not a sentence. It doesn\u2019t have a verb. It\u2019s a fragment! On the passages selected for the SAT, though, following language conventions is important. Sentence Structure On these questions, the task is to recognize and correct problems in how sentences are formed. Sentence boundaries: Recognize and correct grammatically incomplete sentences. Example: Unable to keep her eyes open. Sarah fell asleep in the passenger seat. Read the first half of the example: \u201cUnable to keep her eyes open.\u201d This is not a complete sentence; it\u2019s a fragment that is modifying \u201cSarah\u201d in the next part of the sentence. The sentence that follows (\u201cSarah fell asleep in the passenger seat) is a complete sentence, but the first part of the sentence needs to be linked to it in order for the first part to make sense. You can combine these two parts of the sentence with a comma. Corrected version: Unable to keep her eyes open, Sarah fell asleep in the passenger seat. Subordination and coordination: Recognize and correct problems in how major parts of sentences are related. Example: Although he loves ice cream, Bert tried every flavor at the new dessert shop downtown. In this case, the subordinating conjunction \u201calthough\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense because it presents a possible contrast. Its meaning is that, in spite of some information (for example, Bert\u2019s love of ice cream), something unexpected happened. We could fix this sentence in a couple of different ways, depending on the meaning we\u2019re trying to achieve. Solution 1: Although he loves ice cream, Bert decided not to visit the new dessert shop. In this case, the subordinating conjunction \u201calthough\u201d correctly prefaces an unexpected result: Bert decided not to go to the dessert store despite his love for ice cream. Or: Solution 2: Because he loves ice cream, Bert tried every flavor at the new dessert shop. In this case, the coordinating conjunction \u201cbecause\u201d links the idea that Bert loves ice cream, so he tried every flavor. Oh and by the way, there is no rule against starting a sentence with the word \u201cbecause\u201d ! Parallel structure: treat grammatically similar structures in the same way. Example: In her spare time, Renata spoke to the iguanas, ran with the wild boars, and was climbing coconut trees. This sentence does not have parallel structure because the final element of the sentence ( and was climbing coconut trees ) is not presented in the same verb tense or structure as the first two elements in the list. Corrected version: In her spare time, Renata spoke to the iguanas, ran with the wild boars, and climbed coconut trees. Modifier placement: Recognize and correct problems with modifier placement, including dangling and misplaced modifiers. Example: Speechless, it was hard for Margo to believe that her friends had forgotten their beach towels on their beach trip. The adjective \u201cspeechless\u201d is modifying \u201cMargo\u201d because it\u2019s describing how she feels. If \u201cspeechless\u201d is starting the sentence, \u201cMargo\u201d needs to follow immediately after so it\u2019s clear what the adjective is modifying. Corrected version : Speechless, Margo couldn\u2019t believe that her friends had forgotten their beach towels on their beach trip. Inappropriate shifts in verb tense, mood, and voice: inappropriate shifts from past to present tense, indicative to conditional mood, or active to passive voice Example: Until yesterday, Ana has never been to the zoo. This sentence shifts to the present tense when it should be in past perfect. \u201cYesterday\u201d indicates past tense, and the past perfect would indicate a time in the past before \u201cyesterday.\u201d Corrected version : Until yesterday, Ana had never been to the zoo. Inappropriate shifts in pronoun person and number: recognize and correct an inappropriate shift from a second person to a third person pronoun (such as from \u201cyou\u201d to \u201cone\u201d) or from a singular to a plural pronoun Example: I bought a crate of oranges and delivered them to my grandmother\u2019s house. In this case, the pronoun needs to agree with the singular noun \u201ccrate\u201d (\u201ccrate of oranges\u201d). Corrected version: I bought a crate of oranges and delivered it to my grandmother\u2019s house. Conventions of Usage \u201cUsage\u201d is a term used to describe a range of language practices that are widely accepted and understood by people speaking and writing the same language within a particular culture or community. Particular \u201crules\u201d for speaking and writing solidify over time (often over many generations) and become the standard by which formal speech and writing are judged. The SAT focuses on a small subset of rules about which there is little to no disagreement in academic circles. Pronoun clarity: Recognize and correct ambiguous or vague pronouns (pronouns with more than one possible antecedent or no clear antecedent at all) Example: Molly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at her house yesterday afternoon. Reread the example sentence: \u201cMolly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at her house yesterday afternoon\". Whose house? The pronoun \u201cher\u201d could refer to either Molly or Saira. In the corrected version, the writer specifies \u201cSaira\u2019s house\u201d to give the readers clarity. Corrected version : Molly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at Saira\u2019s house yesterday afternoon. Possessive determiners: Distinguish between and among possessive determiners (\u201cits,\u201d \u201cyour,\u201d \u201ctheir\u201d), contractions (\u201cit\u2019s,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re,\u201d \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d), and adverbs (\u201cthere\u201d) Example: Al\u2019s Cake Shop is known for it\u2019s old-fashioned glazed donuts. This is a common mix-up: in the example sentence, the writer has mistaken the contraction it\u2019s (\u201cit is\u201d) for the possessive determiner \u201cits.\u201d The shop is known for its donuts, not known for it is donuts. Corrected version: Al\u2019s Cake Shop is known for its old-fashioned glazed donuts. Agreement: Ensure grammatical agreement between subject and verb, between pronoun and antecedent, and between nouns Example: Rita and her friend Jorge has decided to join the swim team. Reread the example sentence and ask yourself what the subject of this sentence is. The subject of the sentence is two people: Rita and Jorge. Both of them are joining the swim team, so the verb being used in this sentence needs to be a plural to agree with the number of people being discussed ( have , not has . ) Corrected version: _Rita and her friend Jorge have decided to join the swim team. Frequently confused words: Distinguish between and among words that are commonly mistaken for one another (e.g., \u201caffect\u201dand \u201ceffect\u201d) Example 1: Maria was in shock as she climbed the stage to except her award for Best Actress. In the example sentence, the writer has confused the words \u201cexcept\u201d and \u201caccept,\u201d which sound similar but have two different meanings. Corrected version: Maria was in shock as she climbed the stage to accept her award for Best Actress. \u200b Example 2: The movie Colonel Justice had a profound affect on me. In this sentence, the writer has confused the verb \u201caffect\u201d for the noun \u201ceffect.\u201d Corrected version: The movie Colonel Justice had a profound effect on me. \u200b Example 3: Kelsey chose a blue sweater that would compliment the color of her eyes. The writer has confused the verb \u201ccompliment,\u201d or to praise someone, for the verb \u201ccomplement,\u201d which means to match or pair well. Corrected version: Kelsey chose a blue sweater that would complement the color of her eyes. Logical comparison: Recognizing and correcting cases in which unlike terms are compared Example: The cost of living in the city differs from the suburbs. Reread the example sentence. What is being compared? Instead of comparing the cost of living in the city and in the suburb \u2014 two similar concepts \u2014 the sentence actually compares a concept (cost of living) with a location (suburb). The corrected version fixes this by adding \u201cthat in,\u201d a reference to cost of living in the second half of the sentence. Corrected version: The cost of living in the city differs from that in the suburbs. Conventional expression: Recognize and correct cases in which word choice doesn\u2019t conform to the practices of standard written English. These questions can be especially tough for those who are learning English as non-native speakers. There isn\u2019t necessarily a good reason why an expression might use one preposition instead of another, but the more fluent you become, the more you will recognize how to fix these problems! Example 1: Trevor realized, after Suki failed on responding after six weeks for daily text messages, that she would never fall on love at him. Trevor realized, after Suki failed to respond after six weeks of daily text messages, that she would never fall in love with him. \u200b Example 2: Clara arrived at San Francisco three days ahead on schedule. Clara arrived in San Francisco three days ahead of schedule. \u200b Example 3: After she sat with the bubble gum for her new skirt, she was next to herself. After she sat on the bubble gum in her new skirt, she was beside herself. \u200b Example 4: I never thought I would run from office, but I hope for you will vote on me. I never thought I would run for office, but I hope you will vote for me. Conventions of Punctuation The SAT Writing and Language Test includes questions that require you to recognize and correct the misuse of various forms of punctuation, including end punctuation (periods, question marks, and exclamation points), commas, semicolons, colons, and dashes. In some cases, you\u2019ll be asked to add punctuation to clarify and enhance meaning. End-of-sentence punctuation: Use the correct form of ending punctuation (period, question mark, or exclamation point) when the context makes the writer\u2019s intent clear. Example: Andr\u00e9s wondered if he should save his money for a rainy day or go to an amusement park instead? Ask yourself: is the sentence a question or a statement? While Andr\u00e9s is wondering about something, which might suggest a question, the sentence itself is a statement. Consider another example: \u201cI asked my mom if I could have some milk.\u201d The sentence refers to a question, but it\u2019s also a statement of fact: I asked my mom about something. Corrected version: Andr\u00e9s wondered if he should save his money for a rainy day or go to an amusement park instead. Within-sentence punctuation: Correctly use, as well as recognize and correct misuses of colons, semicolons, and dashes. Example: I can\u2019t wait for this weekend, my friends and I are going river rafting. In the example sentence, two independent clauses are being joined by only a comma. This is called a comma splice. To fix it, replace the comma with more heavy-duty punctuation like a semicolon or a period. Corrected version: I can\u2019t wait for this weekend; my friends and I are going river rafting. Possessive nouns and pronouns: Recognize and correct inappropriate uses of possessive nouns and pronouns and decide between plural and possessive forms. Example: My dogs\u2019 favorite treat is his milk bone. Reread the example sentence. How many dogs are there? Based on the singular pronoun \u201chis\u201d in the second part of the sentence, the answer is one dog. But by placing the apostrophe after the word \u201cdogs,\u201d the writer has created a possessive plural , indicating more than one dog. To fix this, move the apostrophe after \u201cdog\u201d and before the possessive \u201cs,\u201d creating a possessive singular that matches the number of dogs in the sentence. Corrected version: My dog\u2019s favorite treat is his milk bone. Items in a series: Use commas and sometimes semicolons to separate lists of items. \u200b Example 1: Tina got a car wash; went to the pharmacy, and bought a sled.* In this simple list of items, only commas are needed to separate sentence elements, not semicolons. Corrected version: Tina got a car wash, went to the pharmacy, and bought a sled. \u200b Example 2: Juan has been to Paris, France, Venice, Italy, and Kyoto, Japan. This sentence is what\u2019s known as a complex list. Items within the sentence are being separated by commas (e.g. the comma between \u201cParis\u201d and \u201cFrance\u201d separates the city of Paris from the country in which it\u2019s located: France). That means we need a bigger distinction between these city/country pairs so that they don\u2019t run together in the sentence. This is where semicolons come in to help! Corrected version: Juan has been to Paris, France; Venice, Italy; and Kyoto, Japan. Nonrestrictive and parenthetical elements: Use punctuation to set off nonessential sentence elements and recognize and correct cases in which punctuation is wrongly used to set off essential sentence elements \u200b Example 1: Ari\u2019s Candy Corn Emporium, located off Highway 12 is a popular tourist attraction. \u201cLocated off Highway 12\u201d is a parenthetical element that needs to be set off with punctuation on either side of it to distinguish it from the rest of the sentence. Corrected version: Ari\u2019s Candy Corn Emporium, located off Highway 12, is a popular tourist attraction. \u200b Example 2: The Boston Symphony a world-renowned orchestra -- played Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture. \u201ca world-renowned orchestra\u201d is a parenthetical element that needs to be set off with punctuation on either side of it to distinguish it from the rest of the sentence. Corrected version: The Boston Symphony -- a world-renowned orchestra -- played Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture. \u200b Example 3: The bat -- a type of small mammal, can glide and fly. When you have a parenthetical element in your sentence, it needs to be set off with the same type of punctuation on either side. Corrected version: The bat, a type of small mammal, can glide and fly. OR, The bat -- a type of small mammal -- can glide and fly. Unnecessary punctuation: Recognize and eliminate unneeded punctuation \u200b Example: Emily can\u2019t decide if she wants a pet unicorn, or a pet griffin. No comma is necessary after \u201cunicorn.\u201d The writer is making a comparison between two things and no punctuation is needed between them. Corrected version: Emily can\u2019t decide if she wants a pet unicorn or a pet griffin. REMEMBER Observing standard English conventions is about more than ticking off items on a long list of grammar, punctuation, and usage rules; rather, it\u2019s closely tied to the meaning a writer wishes to convey.","title":"Solving Standard English Conventions Questions"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/07_standard_english/#solving-standard-english-conventions-questions","text":"On the SAT Writing and Language test, you will be asked to fix parts of a passage where a writer has not used a standard convention.

What's a convention? \u201cConventions\u201d is just another way of saying \u201cstandard practices and expectations that people follow on a daily basis.\u201d We rely on conventions in most of life: driving in the correct lane, waiting our turn to pay at the store, making room for people on the sidewalk or in an elevator, and so much more. \u201cStandard English Conventions\u201d can be thought of as \u201cwriting guidelines.\u201d Of course, people violate language conventions all the time. Writers might intentionally ignore a convention to achieve a particular purpose; for example, sentence fragments break convention by lacking key elements of a typical sentence but, in certain cases, they can be very effective in creating emphasis, reflecting surprise or shock: Example: I just ate the last macaroon. The one with the sprinkles. \u201cThe one with sprinkles\u201d is not a sentence. It doesn\u2019t have a verb. It\u2019s a fragment! On the passages selected for the SAT, though, following language conventions is important.","title":"Solving Standard English Conventions Questions"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/07_standard_english/#sentence-structure","text":"On these questions, the task is to recognize and correct problems in how sentences are formed. Sentence boundaries: Recognize and correct grammatically incomplete sentences. Example: Unable to keep her eyes open. Sarah fell asleep in the passenger seat. Read the first half of the example: \u201cUnable to keep her eyes open.\u201d This is not a complete sentence; it\u2019s a fragment that is modifying \u201cSarah\u201d in the next part of the sentence. The sentence that follows (\u201cSarah fell asleep in the passenger seat) is a complete sentence, but the first part of the sentence needs to be linked to it in order for the first part to make sense. You can combine these two parts of the sentence with a comma. Corrected version: Unable to keep her eyes open, Sarah fell asleep in the passenger seat. Subordination and coordination: Recognize and correct problems in how major parts of sentences are related. Example: Although he loves ice cream, Bert tried every flavor at the new dessert shop downtown. In this case, the subordinating conjunction \u201calthough\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense because it presents a possible contrast. Its meaning is that, in spite of some information (for example, Bert\u2019s love of ice cream), something unexpected happened. We could fix this sentence in a couple of different ways, depending on the meaning we\u2019re trying to achieve. Solution 1: Although he loves ice cream, Bert decided not to visit the new dessert shop. In this case, the subordinating conjunction \u201calthough\u201d correctly prefaces an unexpected result: Bert decided not to go to the dessert store despite his love for ice cream. Or: Solution 2: Because he loves ice cream, Bert tried every flavor at the new dessert shop. In this case, the coordinating conjunction \u201cbecause\u201d links the idea that Bert loves ice cream, so he tried every flavor. Oh and by the way, there is no rule against starting a sentence with the word \u201cbecause\u201d ! Parallel structure: treat grammatically similar structures in the same way. Example: In her spare time, Renata spoke to the iguanas, ran with the wild boars, and was climbing coconut trees. This sentence does not have parallel structure because the final element of the sentence ( and was climbing coconut trees ) is not presented in the same verb tense or structure as the first two elements in the list. Corrected version: In her spare time, Renata spoke to the iguanas, ran with the wild boars, and climbed coconut trees. Modifier placement: Recognize and correct problems with modifier placement, including dangling and misplaced modifiers. Example: Speechless, it was hard for Margo to believe that her friends had forgotten their beach towels on their beach trip. The adjective \u201cspeechless\u201d is modifying \u201cMargo\u201d because it\u2019s describing how she feels. If \u201cspeechless\u201d is starting the sentence, \u201cMargo\u201d needs to follow immediately after so it\u2019s clear what the adjective is modifying. Corrected version : Speechless, Margo couldn\u2019t believe that her friends had forgotten their beach towels on their beach trip. Inappropriate shifts in verb tense, mood, and voice: inappropriate shifts from past to present tense, indicative to conditional mood, or active to passive voice Example: Until yesterday, Ana has never been to the zoo. This sentence shifts to the present tense when it should be in past perfect. \u201cYesterday\u201d indicates past tense, and the past perfect would indicate a time in the past before \u201cyesterday.\u201d Corrected version : Until yesterday, Ana had never been to the zoo. Inappropriate shifts in pronoun person and number: recognize and correct an inappropriate shift from a second person to a third person pronoun (such as from \u201cyou\u201d to \u201cone\u201d) or from a singular to a plural pronoun Example: I bought a crate of oranges and delivered them to my grandmother\u2019s house. In this case, the pronoun needs to agree with the singular noun \u201ccrate\u201d (\u201ccrate of oranges\u201d). Corrected version: I bought a crate of oranges and delivered it to my grandmother\u2019s house.","title":"Sentence Structure"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/07_standard_english/#conventions-of-usage","text":"\u201cUsage\u201d is a term used to describe a range of language practices that are widely accepted and understood by people speaking and writing the same language within a particular culture or community. Particular \u201crules\u201d for speaking and writing solidify over time (often over many generations) and become the standard by which formal speech and writing are judged. The SAT focuses on a small subset of rules about which there is little to no disagreement in academic circles. Pronoun clarity: Recognize and correct ambiguous or vague pronouns (pronouns with more than one possible antecedent or no clear antecedent at all) Example: Molly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at her house yesterday afternoon. Reread the example sentence: \u201cMolly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at her house yesterday afternoon\". Whose house? The pronoun \u201cher\u201d could refer to either Molly or Saira. In the corrected version, the writer specifies \u201cSaira\u2019s house\u201d to give the readers clarity. Corrected version : Molly and Saira had tea and sandwiches at Saira\u2019s house yesterday afternoon. Possessive determiners: Distinguish between and among possessive determiners (\u201cits,\u201d \u201cyour,\u201d \u201ctheir\u201d), contractions (\u201cit\u2019s,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re,\u201d \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d), and adverbs (\u201cthere\u201d) Example: Al\u2019s Cake Shop is known for it\u2019s old-fashioned glazed donuts. This is a common mix-up: in the example sentence, the writer has mistaken the contraction it\u2019s (\u201cit is\u201d) for the possessive determiner \u201cits.\u201d The shop is known for its donuts, not known for it is donuts. Corrected version: Al\u2019s Cake Shop is known for its old-fashioned glazed donuts. Agreement: Ensure grammatical agreement between subject and verb, between pronoun and antecedent, and between nouns Example: Rita and her friend Jorge has decided to join the swim team. Reread the example sentence and ask yourself what the subject of this sentence is. The subject of the sentence is two people: Rita and Jorge. Both of them are joining the swim team, so the verb being used in this sentence needs to be a plural to agree with the number of people being discussed ( have , not has . ) Corrected version: _Rita and her friend Jorge have decided to join the swim team. Frequently confused words: Distinguish between and among words that are commonly mistaken for one another (e.g., \u201caffect\u201dand \u201ceffect\u201d) Example 1: Maria was in shock as she climbed the stage to except her award for Best Actress. In the example sentence, the writer has confused the words \u201cexcept\u201d and \u201caccept,\u201d which sound similar but have two different meanings. Corrected version: Maria was in shock as she climbed the stage to accept her award for Best Actress. \u200b Example 2: The movie Colonel Justice had a profound affect on me. In this sentence, the writer has confused the verb \u201caffect\u201d for the noun \u201ceffect.\u201d Corrected version: The movie Colonel Justice had a profound effect on me. \u200b Example 3: Kelsey chose a blue sweater that would compliment the color of her eyes. The writer has confused the verb \u201ccompliment,\u201d or to praise someone, for the verb \u201ccomplement,\u201d which means to match or pair well. Corrected version: Kelsey chose a blue sweater that would complement the color of her eyes. Logical comparison: Recognizing and correcting cases in which unlike terms are compared Example: The cost of living in the city differs from the suburbs. Reread the example sentence. What is being compared? Instead of comparing the cost of living in the city and in the suburb \u2014 two similar concepts \u2014 the sentence actually compares a concept (cost of living) with a location (suburb). The corrected version fixes this by adding \u201cthat in,\u201d a reference to cost of living in the second half of the sentence. Corrected version: The cost of living in the city differs from that in the suburbs. Conventional expression: Recognize and correct cases in which word choice doesn\u2019t conform to the practices of standard written English. These questions can be especially tough for those who are learning English as non-native speakers. There isn\u2019t necessarily a good reason why an expression might use one preposition instead of another, but the more fluent you become, the more you will recognize how to fix these problems! Example 1: Trevor realized, after Suki failed on responding after six weeks for daily text messages, that she would never fall on love at him. Trevor realized, after Suki failed to respond after six weeks of daily text messages, that she would never fall in love with him. \u200b Example 2: Clara arrived at San Francisco three days ahead on schedule. Clara arrived in San Francisco three days ahead of schedule. \u200b Example 3: After she sat with the bubble gum for her new skirt, she was next to herself. After she sat on the bubble gum in her new skirt, she was beside herself. \u200b Example 4: I never thought I would run from office, but I hope for you will vote on me. I never thought I would run for office, but I hope you will vote for me.","title":"Conventions of Usage"},{"location":"writing/khan_academy/07_standard_english/#conventions-of-punctuation","text":"The SAT Writing and Language Test includes questions that require you to recognize and correct the misuse of various forms of punctuation, including end punctuation (periods, question marks, and exclamation points), commas, semicolons, colons, and dashes. In some cases, you\u2019ll be asked to add punctuation to clarify and enhance meaning. End-of-sentence punctuation: Use the correct form of ending punctuation (period, question mark, or exclamation point) when the context makes the writer\u2019s intent clear. Example: Andr\u00e9s wondered if he should save his money for a rainy day or go to an amusement park instead? Ask yourself: is the sentence a question or a statement? While Andr\u00e9s is wondering about something, which might suggest a question, the sentence itself is a statement. Consider another example: \u201cI asked my mom if I could have some milk.\u201d The sentence refers to a question, but it\u2019s also a statement of fact: I asked my mom about something. Corrected version: Andr\u00e9s wondered if he should save his money for a rainy day or go to an amusement park instead. Within-sentence punctuation: Correctly use, as well as recognize and correct misuses of colons, semicolons, and dashes. Example: I can\u2019t wait for this weekend, my friends and I are going river rafting. In the example sentence, two independent clauses are being joined by only a comma. This is called a comma splice. To fix it, replace the comma with more heavy-duty punctuation like a semicolon or a period. Corrected version: I can\u2019t wait for this weekend; my friends and I are going river rafting. Possessive nouns and pronouns: Recognize and correct inappropriate uses of possessive nouns and pronouns and decide between plural and possessive forms. Example: My dogs\u2019 favorite treat is his milk bone. Reread the example sentence. How many dogs are there? Based on the singular pronoun \u201chis\u201d in the second part of the sentence, the answer is one dog. But by placing the apostrophe after the word \u201cdogs,\u201d the writer has created a possessive plural , indicating more than one dog. To fix this, move the apostrophe after \u201cdog\u201d and before the possessive \u201cs,\u201d creating a possessive singular that matches the number of dogs in the sentence. Corrected version: My dog\u2019s favorite treat is his milk bone. Items in a series: Use commas and sometimes semicolons to separate lists of items. \u200b Example 1: Tina got a car wash; went to the pharmacy, and bought a sled.* In this simple list of items, only commas are needed to separate sentence elements, not semicolons. Corrected version: Tina got a car wash, went to the pharmacy, and bought a sled. \u200b Example 2: Juan has been to Paris, France, Venice, Italy, and Kyoto, Japan. This sentence is what\u2019s known as a complex list. Items within the sentence are being separated by commas (e.g. the comma between \u201cParis\u201d and \u201cFrance\u201d separates the city of Paris from the country in which it\u2019s located: France). That means we need a bigger distinction between these city/country pairs so that they don\u2019t run together in the sentence. This is where semicolons come in to help! Corrected version: Juan has been to Paris, France; Venice, Italy; and Kyoto, Japan. Nonrestrictive and parenthetical elements: Use punctuation to set off nonessential sentence elements and recognize and correct cases in which punctuation is wrongly used to set off essential sentence elements \u200b Example 1: Ari\u2019s Candy Corn Emporium, located off Highway 12 is a popular tourist attraction. \u201cLocated off Highway 12\u201d is a parenthetical element that needs to be set off with punctuation on either side of it to distinguish it from the rest of the sentence. Corrected version: Ari\u2019s Candy Corn Emporium, located off Highway 12, is a popular tourist attraction. \u200b Example 2: The Boston Symphony a world-renowned orchestra -- played Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture. \u201ca world-renowned orchestra\u201d is a parenthetical element that needs to be set off with punctuation on either side of it to distinguish it from the rest of the sentence. Corrected version: The Boston Symphony -- a world-renowned orchestra -- played Tchaikovsky\u2019s 1812 Overture. \u200b Example 3: The bat -- a type of small mammal, can glide and fly. When you have a parenthetical element in your sentence, it needs to be set off with the same type of punctuation on either side. Corrected version: The bat, a type of small mammal, can glide and fly. OR, The bat -- a type of small mammal -- can glide and fly. Unnecessary punctuation: Recognize and eliminate unneeded punctuation \u200b Example: Emily can\u2019t decide if she wants a pet unicorn, or a pet griffin. No comma is necessary after \u201cunicorn.\u201d The writer is making a comparison between two things and no punctuation is needed between them.
